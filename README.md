# Luis Servin's Tic Tac Toe Game.

Luis Servin's Tic Tac Toe Game is a project that uses CSS, HTML and Javascript to make a fully functional Tic tac toe game. I chose this project in order to practice my coding and create something that i enjoy and thus continues to breathe life into my desire to continue as a Software Engineer. 

## Installation

No Installations are needed


## Usage

This game and the code could really be seperated and explained into three topics.
    1. Players pulled from db.json
    2. Score Board
    3. Tic Tac Toe Game Board

The first component uses the images and data stored on the local server (db.json). The players or images used are not mine but all credit goes to the owners of said pictures (i.natgeofe.com; t2.gstatic.com). Objects and more descriptions are under each player and can be displayed on the app. However, due to time i chose to keep it simple.

The second component is the Score Board. The score board is designed by using multiple buttons as well as event listeners to add or subtract numbers from the board. 

The third and main component of the app is the Game Board. The Game Board was designed by using grids in placed by HTMl. There is a hovering functionality that allows the user to see where they will be placing the marker. Event listeners are also used to place the "X" or "O". Once the game has been won or there is a draw, an object appears with an event listener and another button that will allow the user to reset the game.
